let's try to make a diary here 😁

today I found a whole bathroom lamp from Ikea in original package, hopefully it works 

had a really nice talk today. got back to barking around with the dirt hounds....
and this was not even the biggest problem 🤦🏻‍♀️

still managed to keep learning Arabic inspite of the biggest recent problem

crazy day

contemplating yet another crazy plan

randomly started a dance class today - so much fun 😊

finally met up with one friend again - was really nice 🙂

contemplating getting to know an economics student from a train 😅

quite a good day today 😊

his family is amazing 😍

tomorrow is my big day 😅🤩🥰

looks like I missed a day on my big day, but I was definitely too excited. it went well although not quite according to the plan. now life goes on and we'll see what comes next ☺️

feeling kinda exhausted both physically and emotionally 

hopefully I will get going with some job soon, but still feeling depressed 

got out of the rut but still challenged by my to-do list

 enter sense 8

I must really start committing something meaningful 

let's see if I really manage to go to the swimming pool today 

had a pretty good start into the day today, we'll see what it brings 

just when I thought there's nothing more to become a big urgent problem - bang! citizenship... I don't know how can I keep calm and proceed in solving my problems 

missed a day yesterday but at least I got a relaxed sleep 

woke up before 7 and gave up on trying to sleep further. feeling quite fit currently but I have no idea how can I last through both birthday parties today if I am already not sleeping, gotta buy some redbull I guess 😅

j."Vašek" and princess Elisa have populated my head way too densely. I sencerely hope they are poly too, it could be the case. anyways maybe we'll cross ways in Mainz, or maybe they just write me, can't stop thinking about them

still tired from the weekend but I would say it was worth it 😅 also managed to rearrange the furniture so that my room is still walkable. hopefully soon I get to move to the new place anyways 😁

hopefully I will get the approval today and then nothing stands in my way to finally get back on track with my life 
okay so once again, one can't simply get out of a shit hole....

Bad news: getting ill
good news: staying on track with the room 

bad news: even more ill, but maybe beyond half already
good news: looks like I'm gonna get a room with a breakfast buddy 🥰

slowly getting done with the illness, having a mess in the decisions around possible rooms. meanwhile got a kind of a job interview, looks promising, maybe I will get to stay in Frankfurt after all. j.vasek is still somewhere on the horizon, not more and not less 😅

let's try to make a diary here 😁

today I found a whole bathroom lamp from Ikea in original package, hopefully it works 

had a really nice talk today. got back to barking around with the dirt hounds....
and this was not even the biggest problem 🤦🏻‍♀️

still managed to keep learning Arabic inspite of the biggest recent problem

crazy day

contemplating yet another crazy plan

randomly started a dance class today - so much fun 😊

finally met up with one friend again - was really nice 🙂

contemplating getting to know an economics student from a train 😅

quite a good day today 😊

his family is amazing 😍

tomorrow is my big day 😅🤩🥰

looks like I missed a day on my big day, but I was definitely too excited. it went well although not quite according to the plan. now life goes on and we'll see what comes next ☺️

feeling kinda exhausted both physically and emotionally 

hopefully I will get going with some job soon, but still feeling depressed 

got out of the rut but still challenged by my to-do list

 enter sense 8

I must really start committing something meaningful

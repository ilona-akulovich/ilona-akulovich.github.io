let's try to make a diary here 😁

today I found a whole bathroom lamp from Ikea in original package, hopefully it works 

had a really nice talk today. got back to barking around with the dirt hounds....
and this was not even the biggest problem 🤦🏻‍♀️

still managed to keep learning Arabic inspite of the biggest recent problem

crazy day

contemplating yet another crazy plan

randomly started a dance class today - so much fun 😊

finally met up with one friend again - was really nice 🙂

contemplating getting to know an economics student from a train 😅

quite a good day today 😊

his family is amazing 😍

tomorrow is my big day 😅🤩🥰

looks like I missed a day on my big day, but I was definitely too excited. it went well although not quite according to the plan. now life goes on and we'll see what comes next ☺️

feeling kinda exhausted both physically and emotionally 

hopefully I will get going with some job soon, but still feeling depressed 

got out of the rut but still challenged by my to-do list

 enter sense 8

I must really start committing something meaningful 

let's see if I really manage to go to the swimming pool today 

had a pretty good start into the day today, we'll see what it brings 

just when I thought there's nothing more to become a big urgent problem - bang! citizenship... I don't know how can I keep calm and proceed in solving my problems 

missed a day yesterday but at least I got a relaxed sleep 

woke up before 7 and gave up on trying to sleep further. feeling quite fit currently but I have no idea how can I last through both birthday parties today if I am already not sleeping, gotta buy some redbull I guess 😅

j."Vašek" and princess Elisa have populated my head way too densely. I sencerely hope they are poly too, it could be the case. anyways maybe we'll cross ways in Mainz, or maybe they just write me, can't stop thinking about them
